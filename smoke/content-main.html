There are millions of animal, insect, and plant species to see in the rainforest—so much so, that scientists still believe they haven’t discovered or cataloged every different kind. Paraiso area in the Peruvian Amazon is a hotspot for wildlife. It includes Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo Reserve, where more than 10 species of monkeys, 600 species of birds, and bats, frogs, caiman, capibaras, and dolphins run, jump, fly or swim freely.
            The rainforests in South America are part of the 2 percent of rainforests found on the total surface area of the Earth. Though they only cover a small part of our planet, they contain upwards of 50% of the world’s plant and animal life. In addition, rainforests provide 20% of the oxygen we breathe.

            The rainforest is truly a wonder to behold. Give us a call today to set up your uniquely tailored, private Amazon Jungle adventure!
