            Marvel at the world's tallest waterfall from above in a light aircraft, or reach the base of the falls by dugout canoe.

            At 979m in height, Angel Falls is the world's tallest waterfall. It has a suitably dramatic setting within Venezuela's ‘Lost World’: a wild and isolated region known as the Gran Sabana, where table mountains poke through the clouds and rivers cascade over beds of jasper.

            There is no road or permanent settlement close to the waterfall, and indeed it lies hidden in an area so remote that just 60 years ago this kilometre-high cascade was unknown to the outside world. Even today, Angel Falls retains its untouched beauty and offers an undiminished sense of wonder to the lucky few who get to discover it for themselves.

            There are still only two ways to visit – either by flying overhead in a light aircraft for astonishing panoramic views, or on an adventurous boat journey along a river flanked by table mountains. Whichever you choose, it’s still very much possible to recapture the sense of astonishment that Jimmie Angel, the American pilot who crash-landed here in the 30s, must have felt as he first caught sight of this incomparable natural wonder.

            Angel Falls is one of Venezuela's top tourist attractions, though a trip to the falls is a complicated affair. The falls are located in an isolated jungle. A flight from Maiquetia Airport, Puerto Ordaz, or Ciudad Bolívar is required to reach Canaima camp, the starting point for river trips to the base of the falls. River trips generally take place from June to December, when the rivers are deep enough for use by the Pemon guides. During the dry season (December to March), the volume of water is less than in other months.
