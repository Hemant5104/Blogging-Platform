            One of the youngest mountain ranges, the Himalayas is home to many of the highest mountains, including Everest. At 29,035 feet (8,850 metres), Everest is the highest mountain on earth and one of the most mystical. It seems to compel climbers to attempt a summit, even when knowing the immense risks.

            The mystical quality of the Himalayas is intrinsic to the cultures it touches. To the people of these regions, the Himalayas is much more than an impressive geographical feature. The name Himalaya means the “abode of snow,” and it is also the abode of Lord Shiva – one of the primary gods in India – and many other deities as well.

            There are many good reasons to visit this beautiful region – especially nowadays when so much of the world is over-touristed, or spoiled by pollution and over-development. These are just a few. You could try a guided hiking tour — there are tours available throughout the Himalayas, such as the Annapurna Circuit Trek in Nepal.

            The Himalaya mountains present some of the most incredible landscapes and stunning scenery on the planet. Many photographers flock to this region for photographic reasons alone. As the sun rises or sets, the white peaks can be seen to light up in multi-colours — such as from Tiger Hill outside of Darjeeling. And there are places, such as the legendary Valley of Flowers in Uttarakhand, India, that are so beautiful as to defy description.

            The Himalayas run through Nepal, one of the world’s premier hiking destinations. There are incredible hiking opportunities in India, too, especially in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Many of them are unspoiled, and wind through regions of incomparable beauty. Options range from relatively easy day hikes to extremely arduous multi-day, high-altitude treks to some of the most remote places in the rooftop of the world.
