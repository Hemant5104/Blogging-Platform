            Pick fifty people and ask them about visiting Las Vegas and you’ll probably get fifty different reasons why it’s great. Okay, a few sticks-in-the-mud might not be so jazzed about hitting Sin City, but the point is this: Las Vegas has something to appeal to almost everyone and you’re sure to take home with you some incredible memories. Doesn’t matter if you’re on your own, with a group of friends, family, on a business trip, or on the run from the authorities, Las Vegas is a great place to visit.

            Stay away from the casino shops, repeat -- STAY AWAY FROM THE CASINO SHOPS! You won’t find any bargains that close to the gaming tables, those shops are designed to recoup casino losses. But get out of the casinos and you’ll find Las Vegas Premium Outlets and Fashion Outlets Las Vegas, two outlet malls bursting with designer brands at huge discounts. Vegas is also famous for its pawn shops, as long as you don’t mind your merchandise gently used.

            Dining and entertainment get most of the press, but Las Vegas is also a destination for anyone who likes the great outdoors. Red Rock Canyon is only about 20-minutes away and gorgeous Lake Mead is only about an hour outside of the city. Go a little further and you have Death Valley in California and Utah’s Zion National Park. The Grand Canyon is about 5 hours away by car, close enough for a scenic day trip. Las Vegas is squarely in the middle of an outdoor enthusiast’s dream!

            It doesn’t matter what kind of food you like, Las Vegas has a 5-star restaurant where you can find it. The cream of the crop might be L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon at MGM Grand, a gastronome’s delight hosted by France’s "Chef of the Century." Picasso at Bellagio is a 13-time winner of the AAA 5 Diamond Award. Guy Savoy at Caesar’s Palace is the only place in the United States you can taste from the Paris Savoy’s famed menu. Even hamburgers get the royal treatment at Mandalay Bay’s Burger Bar, which offers buffalo, lamb, vegan burgers, and more. C’est magnifique!

            Did you know that Las Vegas is also a center of learning, with some of the world’s most prestigious museums? Actually it’s not, but it does have some museums dedicated to entertaining as much as enlightening. There’s the Mob Museum that celebrates the city’s cozy Mafia traditions. Vegas also hosts the National Atomic Testing Museum, your venue for all things nuclear apocalypse related. The Neon Museum has a boneyard that houses the decrepit remains of the city’s gaudy past, and it seems to grow a little bigger every day.

            Las Vegas annually hosts hundreds of industry conventions, trade shows, corporate retreats, and other business-related events. Its convention center is one of the nation’s busiest and the entire town is geared to help grease the wheels of commerce. You might need to get inventive if you want to declare that $1200 pai gow poker loss as a business expense for tax purposes, but you should have no problem writing off travel expenses, accommodations, dining, and even entertainment. And if you actually win money at the tables, you just turned a profit!
